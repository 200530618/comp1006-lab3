This is lab-03 of php which shows us how to delete and edit from a php page from sql.
so on the details page you can see few clubs and grounds with number and below these you can find two links of delete and edit.
when you click on delete then you can see a popup which ask you a question that you want to delete it or not. but if you delete any detail from the list then that number will aslo 
delete from there means if you delete number 1 then there will be not any number 1 again.
and when you click on edit then it bring you to the edit page where you can change the club name and ground name but not number.
